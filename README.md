📁 Linux Console-Based File Explorer (C++)

A lightweight terminal-based file explorer built using C++ and Linux System Programming.
This project allows users to perform basic file and directory operations directly from the Linux terminal — similar to a simplified shell.

Command / Option	Function:

ls / List Directory	Shows all files and folders in the current directory

cd / Change Directory	Navigate between directories

new / Create File	Creates a new file

del / Delete File	Deletes a file

ren / Rename File	Renames a file

cp / Copy File	Copies one file to another

search / Recursively searches for a file

chmod / Changes file permissions (e.g., 755)

clear / Clears the terminal output

exit / Exits the file explorer


🛠️ Technologies Used:

C++

Linux / WSL / Ubuntu

System programming header files:

<dirent.h>,
<unistd.h>,
<sys/stat.h>,
<fstream>,
<iostream>


📜 Project Outcome

Understood Linux system calls (opendir, readdir, chdir, chmod)

Worked with recursive directory traversal

Learned file management using C++ streams (fstream, ifstream, ofstream)

📎 Future Enhancements

Color-coded output (directories in blue, files in white)

Arrow-key / interactive navigation using ncurses
